"I tore my clothes working at the Mill. I was attacked by some outlaws and they ripped my satchel off my back. I got away, bruised, as well as my horse. I borrowed the gun from a friend in case it ever happens again."
"I was in a fight at the saloon a couple of days ago, I was very drunk and I don't remember much. I took a gun from the store and cart from the stable and crashed it somewhere eastbound. Then I had to buy new clothes because I was covered in mud."
